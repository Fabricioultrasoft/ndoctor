= Introduction =

nDoctor is meant to manage patient's data. This data are encapsulated into a patient session. In other words, it should provide an interface to browse between all the modules that manage the patient data.

 # a patient's data manager
 # a BMI manager
 # a family manager
 # a medical record manager
 # a medical pictures manager
 # a prescription manager
 # a pathologies manager
 # a list of plugins (each plugin is considered as a manager)

= Features =

The patient session should provide:
 * a memento system. That's the user can rollback at any time to the state the session was when it was opened.
 * a _close_ feature that saves all the changes and close the patient session.
 * a global _save_ feature that saves the sate of all the managers. The _save_ feature should be present *only* in the patient session. Therefore the manager *shouldn't* have a visible _save_ button or menu!
