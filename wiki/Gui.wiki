= Concepts =

The GUI is divided into different parts
 # The main menu: It contains all the application wide menu such as:  
  # File: All the menus that don't fit the other menus.
  # View: Provides features to manage the view, it allows to display or hide some windows or menus.
  # Session: Provides options to manage the sessions (create, delete, search users...).
  # Tools: Contains tools to improve the user experience of nDoctor.
  # Help: Contains help information about nDoctor.
 # The contextual menu: this menu changes depending on the selected workbench. It should be a toolbox or a contextual menu if it is a ribbon menu (as in Ms Office)
 # The side menu: It displays all the installed modules.
 # The module menu: It contains all the items of the selected module.
 # The logbox: Provide non interactive logs. That's, information about the state of the application.

Here is the list of the Gui items:
 # Workbench: it is the workbench of the selected item of the selected module. Here you manage the data of nDoctor.
 # Module: it is a collection of items. That's a group of item with the same meaning.
 # Item: it is the smallest part of the Gui. This concept represents the features of a module.
